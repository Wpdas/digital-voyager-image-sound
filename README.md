# Digital Voyager Image Sound

This is a personal application I've been working and the main idea is based on The Voyager Golden Record, a disc created by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) that was sent into space with the Voyager spacecraft in the 1970s. At that time, there were no digital files like today (JPG, TIFF, etc.) so engineers had to use the phonographic resources to encode the images. It took me a while to understand the decoding information on the disc cover and, once I got it, I created the code that encodes and decodes audio samples but in digital format (binary information).

You can use the live app to encode image to sound (wav format) or decode sound to image. The app is compatible with almost all images format.

In theory, the audio generated by this program can be recorded on a vinyl record which, when played, can be decoded using this same program. But this method has not yet been tested because I (the author) do not yet have the necessary equipment.

This app depends on voyager-edsound module core, however, its code is still private yet.

**Desktop / App Stack:** Electron (for Desktop version), React, TypeScript, Yarn, Jimp, Styled-Components, Blueprint;</br>
**Core Stack:** TypeScript, Node, Babel, Yarn.</br>
